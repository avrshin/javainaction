/**
 *
 * Two strings, a and b, are said to be twins only if they can be made equivalent by performing some number of
 * operations on one or both strings. There are two possible operations:

 •	SwapEven: Swap a character at an even-numbered index with a character at another even-numbered index.
 •	SwapOdd: Swap a character at an odd-numbered index with a character at another odd-numbered index.

 For example, a = "abcd" and b = "cdab" are twins because we can make them equivalent by performing operations.
 Alternatively, a = "abcd" and b = "bcda" are not twins (operations do not move characters between odd and even indices), and neither are a = "abc"and b = "ab" (no amount of operations will insert a 'c' into string b).

 Complete the twins function in the editor below. It has two parameters:

 1.	An array of n strings named a.
 2.	An array of n strings named b.

 The function must return an array of strings where each index i (0 ≤ i < n) contains the string Yes if ai
 and bi are twins or the string Noif they are not.

    /*
    Input Format
Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function:
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in a.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < n) contains a string describing ai.
The next line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in b.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < n) contains a string describing bi.

Constraints
•	1 ≤ n ≤ 103
•	1 ≤ lengths of ai, bi ≤ 100
•	ai and bi are not guaranteed to have the same length.
•	Strings ai and bi contain lowercase letters only (i.e., a through z).

Output Format
The function must return an array of strings where each index i (0 ≤ i < n) contains the string Yes if ai
and bi are twins or the string Noif they are not.
